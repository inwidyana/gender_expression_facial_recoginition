This is an implementation of Convolutional Neural Netowk for recognizing whether a man/woman is smiling or not using facial features from a close up photo.

It could classify a picture of man/woman to one of 4 classes: Man Smiling, Man Not Smiling, Woman Smiling, Woman Not Smiling.

The implementation used the keras, pillow and tensorflow library.

***The screenshot for accuracy and loss could be found in: data/sample_output.***

***Image used in this project does not belong to me but come from scrapping google search images.***
